## drlutils

This is code used in the digitization production workflow of the Digital 
Research Library, within the University Library System at the University
of Pittsburgh (from roughly 2006-2015).

A lot of the code relies on and communicated with a separate local Django
application, 'workflow', that is used for tracking items moving through 
the digitization process. However, there are some scripts and utilities 
here that are standalone.

There are also dependencies on other applications, many of them are 
indicated in the 'config.py.example' file.
